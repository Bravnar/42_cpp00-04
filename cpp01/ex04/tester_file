Once upon a time in a faraway land, there lived a brave knight.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
To be, or not to be, that is the question.
All that glitters is not gold.
The early bird catches the worm.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
Actions speak louder than words.
Practice makes perfect.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
Fortune favors the bold.
Birds of a feather flock together.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
A rolling stone gathers no moss.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
A watched pot never boils.
Better late than never.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
All's well that ends well.
A stitch in time saves nine.
Look before you leap.
Barking up the wrong tree.
Curiosity killed the cat.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
Every dog has its day.
Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.
Good things come to those who wait.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
It's no use crying over spilt milk.
Kill two birds with one stone.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
Like father, like son.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
No pain, no gain.
Old habits die hard.
Out of sight, out of mind.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
The best of both worlds.
The cat is out of the bag.
There's no place like home.
Time heals all wounds.
Two heads are better than one.
When the going gets tough, the tough get going.
You can't have your cake and eat it too.
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
